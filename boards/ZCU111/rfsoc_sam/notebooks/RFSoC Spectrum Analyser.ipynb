    "# RFSoC Spectrum Analyser Module (RFSoC SAM)\n",
    "> This notebook presents a flexible hardware accelerated Spectrum Analyser Module for the Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC. The steps outlined in the Table of Contents below will showcase the features and flexibility of the Spectrum Analyser and detail the underlying FPGA architecture. <br><br>\n",
    "The Spectrum Analyser Module was developed by the University of Strathclyde. At this point in time, the analyser is capable of 256MHz of bandwidth and can achieve 7.8125KHz of frequency resolution. The bandwidth is entirely adjustable between 0MHz and 256MHz, and the architecture supports several windowing coefficients including user defined windows. FPGA floating-point arithmetic is also exploited to accurately implement hardware accelerated Power Spectrum calculations, including decibel conversion for power analysis. Plotting and animating the Spectrum is achieved using the [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) libraries. The Plotly library allows the spectrum to be visualised in two different ways; power spectrum frame plots and a Waterfall Plot (Spectrogram). <br><br>\n",

    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "The Zynq RFSoC contains several Analogue-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to-Analogue Converters (DACs) that allow us to communicate with the analogue world (we refer to these as data converters). The Spectrum Analyser Module uses the RFSoC's ADC to receive Radio Frequency (RF) data, and subsequently manipulate it to create an RF spectrum. As shown in the figure below, this system leverages the RFSoC's data converters, Programmable Logic (PL), and Processing System (PS) to visualise the RF Spectrum. Furthermore, this example also uses a transmitter so that there is a signal to inspect in the frequency domain. Only one DAC (Tile 1, Channel 2) will be used in this design. Three ADCs are leveraged and a switch, implemented in the PL, allows the user to select the relevant converter. For the purposes of this notebook and corresponding Voila dashboard the ADCs are referred to as ADC0, ADC1 and ADC2.\n",

    "`ADC1:` Tile 0, Channel 1<br>\n",
    "`ADC2:` Tile 1, Channel 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The design applies an array of techniques such as low-pass filtering, windowing, and a Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) to compute the RF spectrum. A significant portion of the design has been implemented in the RFSoC's PL to relieve the PS of highly computational arithmetic. Furthermore, as the RF data is streaming into the PL, the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic fabric is better suited to manipulating the data in real-time. To keep the design as simple as possible, each block in the Spectrum Analyser Module (and the transmitter block) can be configured or used with a single function. These functions will be required later in this notebook and are detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>`SAM.TransmitterSetup()`</b> - Sets the modulation scheme and transmit frequency of the transmit signal.\n",
    "* <b>`SAM.WindowSetup()`</b> - Creates an interface for the user to load predefined window coefficients. Available windows include Bartlett, Blackman, Hamming, Hanning and Rectangular.\n",
    "* <b>`SAM.ReceiverSetup()`</b> - Sets the center frequency for receiving data, the resolution of the signal inspected, and which ADC to receive data from.\n",
    "* <b>`SAM.SpectrumViewer()`</b> - Creates an animated plot of the FFT data from hardware as well as an animated time domain plot of the FFT data from hardware (using a heatmap).\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the figure below, there are several Direct Memory Access (DMA) cores. These are used to transfer data between the RFSoC's PS and PL with minimal support from the Arm-Cortex A53 processors. For example, the bandwidth selector uses a DMA to change its low-pass filter coeffiecents on the fly. Similarly, the window requires a DMA core to modify the windowing coefficients used in the system. A DMA is essential for the data inspector to pass FFT frames into the PS for analysis and manipulation. Each of these actions normally require signficant processor support, however, using a DMA core reduces software overhead.\n",

    "As we have filtered out unnecessary frequency components, the RF data is then downsampled.

    "## 5. Window Selection\n",
    "Performing an FFT on a finite number of samples, such as a frame, introduces an artefact called <b>Spectral Leakage</b>. This occurs because the signal’s behaviour outside of the captured frame is unknown and the FFT assumes that the signal repeats forever (where the captured frame represents one period). When capturing real signals, the frame will likely have discontinuities at either end. Sharp discontinuities have a large bandwidth which causes the signal’s frequency to be spread across the spectrum. \n",
    "\n",
    "To limit the effects of spectral leakage and smooth out the discontinuities, a <b>window</b> can be applied. Windows reduce the signal’s amplitude at either end of the frame in the time domain thereby reducing the discontinuities between ‘repeating’ frames. There are a number of different windows which can be applied to a signal. Each have their own characteristics and these must be considered for the particular application. Windows with a large mainlobe will decrease the frequency resolution of the signal, in constrast, windows with small side lobes will better reduce spectral leakage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface below allows for a variety of windows to be applied. The coefficients are generated using <b>numpy</b> and can be inspected in both the time and frequency domain before applying them in hardware. \n",
    "When the Load button is clicked, the window coefficients are loaded into the hardware by the DMA and stored in Block RAM (BRAM). The window is applied by multiplying the stored coefficients with the incoming IQ frames. Any DC component that may have been introduced to the signal beforehand is suppressed by subtracting the mean value of each frame from every sample in the window. The figure below illustrates the window’s hardware design in the RFSoC's PL. \n",
